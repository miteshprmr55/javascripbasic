      <!-- Question-2
           
               • What is the use of isNaN function?

            Answer :-
              
               ->  isNaN() returns true if a number is Not-a-Number. In other words: isNaN() converts the value to a number before testing it.

               ->  In JavaScript, NaN stands for Not a Number. It represents a value that is not a valid number. It can be used to check 
                   whether a number entered is a valid number or not a number.

               ->  isNaN() method in Float Class is a built in method in Java returns true if this Float value or the specified float value is 
                   Not-a-Number (NaN), or false otherwise. Parameters: he function accepts a single parameter val which specifies the value to 
                   be checked when called directly with the Float class as static method.
                   
               ->  isNaN() is a function property of the global object. For number values, isNaN() tests if the number is the value NaN . When the 
                   argument to the isNaN() function is not of type Number, the value is first coerced to a number, and the resulting value is then 
                   compared against NaN.
                   
               ->  To tell if a value is NaN , use Number. isNaN() or isNaN() to most clearly determine whether a value is NaN — or, since NaN 
                   is the only value that compares unequal to itself, you can perform a self-comparison like x !== x .
