    <!-- Question:17
    
            â€¢ What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?

        Answer:-
        
             -> * Inner HTML is slow *

                  It is very slow because as inner HTML already parses the content even we have to parse the content 
                  again so that's why it takes time. When we have used the event handlers then the event handlers are
                  not automatically attached to the new elements created by innerHTML.

            -> The innerHTML property is a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) that is used to set or return the HTML
               content of an element. Where the return value represents the text content of the HTML element. It allows 
               JavaScript code to manipulate a website being displayed. More specifically, it sets or returns the HTML
               content (the inner HTML) of an element. The innerHTML property is widely used to modify the contents of a
               webpage as it is the easiest way of modifying DOM. But there are some disadvantages to using innerHTML in
               JavaScript.      

            -> Disadvantages of using innerHTML property in JavaScript:


                *  The use of innerHTML very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as
                   slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.

                *  Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the
                   new elements created by setting innerHTML automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it to new elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.

                *  Content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using
                  innerHTML, all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and 
                  recreated.

                *  Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on 
                   appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.
