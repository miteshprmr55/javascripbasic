             • How to read and write a file using JavaScript?

         Answer:-
           
             -> 1). file=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading the file content.
                2). str = fread(file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write the contents to the file.
                3). file = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.

             -> On the client side, you can’t read or write files in JavaScript browsers. The fs module in Node.js may be used to accomplish
                this on the server-side. It has methods for reading and writing files on the file system that are both synchronous and 
                asynchronous. Let’s demonstrate some examples of reading and writing files with the node.js fs module.

             -> The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript. The file is read using 
                the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method. This technique reads the full file into memory and stores it in a 
                buffer. 

             -> Syntax:

                  fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function )    

             -> filename: It contains the filename to be read, or the whole path if the file is saved elsewhere.
                
                encoding: It stores the file’s encoding. ‘utf8’ is the default setting.
                
                callback function: This is a function that is invoked after the file has been read. It requires two inputs:
                
                err: If there was an error.
                
                data: The file’s content.
                
                Return Value: It returns the contents contained in the file, as well as any errors that may have occurred. 
                
             ->    The fs.writeFile() function is used to write data to a file in an asynchronous manner. If the file already exists, it will
                   be replaced.
