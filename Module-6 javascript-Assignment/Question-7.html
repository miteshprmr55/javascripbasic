    <!-- Question:7
    
              â€¢ What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?

         Answer:-
         
              -> Storage The Viewstate is stored within the page itself (in encrypted text), while the Sessionstate is stored in the server. 
                 Session is used mainly for storing user specific data [ session specific data ].
     
              -> Session State is a way to share variables between reruns, for each user session.

              -> State management is a developing concept that tackles this problem and maintains the current state of UI elements across the 
                 website.

              -> View state and Session state are two types of state management techniques that help developers share information between 
                 different UI elements and interfaces.   

              -> * View state *
                 
                   State management is on the client side.

                   Data is accessible within the same web page.

                   Loss of information occurs when different web page is loaded.

                   Data is stored in a hidden field of the same web page.

                   It's less secure.

         
              -> * Session state *

                   State management is on the server side.

                   Data is accessible from other web pages of the website.

                   Loss of information occurs due to timeout. 

                   Data is stored in sessions and cookies.

                   It's more secure.
