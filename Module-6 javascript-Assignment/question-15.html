    <!-- Question:15
    
              • What is the use of Void (0)?

        Answer:- 
        
            -> JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across the term 
               “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side effects caused
                while inserting an expression in a web page.

            -> You might have occasionally came across “javascript:void(0)” in an HTML Document. It is often used when 
               inserting an expression in a web page might produce some unwanted effect. To remove this effect,
               “javascript:void(0)” is used. This expression returns undefined primitive value. This is often used
               with hyperlinks. Sometimes, you will decide to call some JavaScript from inside a link. Normally, when
               you click a link, the browser loads a brand new page or refreshes the same page (depending on the URL 
               specified). But you most likely don’t desire this to happen if you have hooked up some JavaScript thereto
               link. To prevent the page from refreshing, you could use void(0). 

            -> Using “#” in anchor tag: When writing the following code in the editor, the web page is refreshed after 
               the alert message is shown. 

            -> Historically, void(0) was used to get the undefined value. In the early days of JavaScript, undefined
               could be reassigned, leading to potential confusion and bugs in the code. To prevent this and to ensure 
               they were truly getting undefined , developers would use void(0) instead.
