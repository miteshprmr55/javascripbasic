    <!-- Question:4
    
             â€¢ Which company developed JavaScript?

         Answer:-
         
            ->  JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. Netscape and Eich designed JavaScript as a 
                scripting language for use with the company's flagship web browser, Netscape Navigator.
                
            -> * Brendan Eich *

                JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.
                 After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser.
                 
            -> * Oracle Corporation *

                "JavaScript" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States. The trademark was originally issued to Sun Microsystems
                 on 6 May 1997, and was transferred to Oracle when they acquired Sun in 2009.
