             â€¢ How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?

         Answer:-
         
            -> In JavaScript, we can use window. location object to force a page to load another page. We can use the
               location object to set the URL of a new page.

            -> In this article, we will see how can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript.

            -> Approach: We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in
               Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the
               document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.

            ->  Syntax:

                      <script>
                          window.location = <Path / URL>
                      </script>
