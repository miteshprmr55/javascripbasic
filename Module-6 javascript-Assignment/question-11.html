    <!-- Question:11

            • What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

         Answer:-
           
             -> for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
                
                for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
                
                for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.
                
                while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

                do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true


             -> Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of 
                instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. For example, suppose we want
                to print “Hello World” 10 times. This can be done in two ways as shown below:   
       
             -> Iterative Method: The iterative method to do this is to write the console.log() statement 5 times. 
             
                     console.log("Hello World");
                     console.log("Hello World");
                     console.log("Hello World");
                     console.log("Hello World");
                     console.log("Hello World");

             -> Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

                Often this is the case when working with arrays:
