    <!-- Question:9
    
             â€¢ How can the style/class of an element be changed?

         Answer:-
            
             -> Element Class Names *
                Another way to alter the style of an element is by changing its class attribute. class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so
                in order to access the element's class, you use element. className .

             -> Access the classList property of the selected element to manipulate its classes. Use the replace(oldClass, newClass) method of 
                the classList property to replace the old class name with the new class name.
