             • What is the function of the delete operator?

         Answer:-
          
             -> The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there 
                are no more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released 
                automatically.

             -> In JavaScript, the delete Operator’s main purpose is to remove a property from an object. In this
