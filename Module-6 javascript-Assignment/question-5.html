    <!-- Question:5
    
           â€¢ What are undeclared and undefined variables?

        Answer:-
        
            -> Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined in the current scope, while undefined variables are those 
               that have been declared but not given a value.

            -> An undefined variable in the source code of a computer program is a variable that is accessed in the code but has not been 
               declared by that code. In some programming languages, an implicit declaration is provided the first time such a variable is 
               encountered at compile time.   
    
            -> To recap what we've learned in this blog: a variable is undeclared when the variable has not been created. a variable is
               undefined when the variable is declared, but does not have a value. a variable is null when the variable is declared, and has a 
               value of nothing, the absence of a value.
