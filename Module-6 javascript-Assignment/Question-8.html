    <!-- Question:8
    
            â€¢ What is === operator?

        Answer:-
        
            -> The === operator compares operands and returns true if both operands are of the same data type and have some value, otherwise,
               it returns false. The !== operator compares operands and returns true if both operands are of different data types or are of 
               the same data type but have different values.

            -> The strict equality ( === ) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result.
            
            -> JavaScript Strict Equality Operator is used to compare two operands and return true if both the value and type of operands are
               the same. Since type conversion is not done, so even if the value stored in operands is the same but their type is different the 
               operation will return false. 

            -> Syntax:

                 a===b

            -> Example : In this example, we will compare the value of the same data types.
                
                         let a = 2, b=2, c=3; 
                         let d = {name:"Ram"}; 
                         let e = {name:"Ram"}; 
                         let f = e; 
  
                         console.log(a===b); 
                         console.log(a===c); 
                         console.log(d===e); 
                         console.log(f===e);
