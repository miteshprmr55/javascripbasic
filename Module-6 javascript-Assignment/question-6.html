    <!-- Question:6
    
            â€¢ Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?

        Answer:-
        
            -> appendChild() method to append the dynamically created elements. If you inspect your console, you will see the dynamically 
               created elements injected in your DOM. Now we can add event handlers.

            -> New elements can be dynamically created in JavaScript with the help of 
              * createElement() method.The attributes of the created element can be set using the 
              * setAttribute() method. The examples given below would demonstrate this approach.

            -> Example : In this example, a newly created element is added as a child to the parent element. The type of the element to be 
                         created is specified and its value or text node for the specified element is added.
