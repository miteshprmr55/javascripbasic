            • What is JavaScript?

        Answer :-
           
             ->  JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images,
                 and pretty much ...

             ->  JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a
                 web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, 
                 interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, ...    
 
             ->   It is designed for creating web-centric applications. It is lightweight and interpreted, which makes it much faster than 
                  other languages. JavaScript is integrated with HTML, which makes it easier to implement JavaScript in web applications.

             ->  JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and
                 lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.
