       <!-- Question:3
    
                 • What is negative Infinity?

            Answer:-
            
                 -> The symbol “∞”, (called the lemniscate), is used to denote infinity. It looks like a sideways 8. Similarly, there is a
                    concept called negative infinity, which is less than any real number. The symbol “-∞” is used to denote negative infinity.

                 -> 1 / -∞ = 0. As the denominator (with any fraction, where the numerator is not ∞) gets larger and larger, the ratio becomes
                    smaller and smaller. Therefore, as our denominator approaches infinity (whether it be negative or positive), our ratio 
                    tends to zero.   
    
                 ->  Strictly speaking, negative infinity isn't a number, so the usual rules for greater, smaller, and equal don't apply, but
                     otherwise negative infinity is (much) smaller.

                 ->  Zero is less than infinity. It is also greater than negative infinity.
